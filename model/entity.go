	Field types Permalink to "Field types"

JHipster supports many field types. This support depends on your database backend, so we use Java types to describe them: a Java String will be stored differently in Oracle or Cassandra, and it is one of JHipster’s strengths to generate the correct database access code for you.

	String: A Java String. Its default size depends on the underlying backend (if you use JPA, it’s 255 by default), but you can change it using the validation rules (putting a max size of 1024, for example).
	Integer: A Java Integer.
	Long: A Java Long.
	Float: A Java Float.
	Double: A Java Double.
	BigDecimal: A java.math.BigDecimal object, used when you want exact mathematic calculations (often used for financial operations).
	LocalDate: A java.time.LocalDate object, used to correctly manage dates in Java.
	Instant: A java.time.Instant object, used to represent a timestamp, an instantaneous point on the time-line.
	ZonedDateTime: A java.time.ZonedDateTime object, used to represent a local date-time in a given timezone (typically a calendar appointment). Note that time zones are neither supported by the REST nor by the persistence layers so you should most probably use Instant instead.
	Duration: A java.time.Duration object, used to represent an amount of time.
	UUID: A java.util.UUID.
	Boolean: A Java Boolean.
	Enumeration: A Java Enumeration object. When this type is selected, the sub-generator will ask you what values you want in your enumeration, and it will create a specific enum class to store them.
	Blob: A Blob object, used to store some binary data. When this type is selected, the sub-generator will ask you if you want to store generic binary data, an image object, or a CLOB (long text). Images will be handled specifically on the Angular side, so they can be displayed to the end-user.
